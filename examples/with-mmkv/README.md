# MMKV Example

This example demonstrates that [`react-native-mmkv`](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) can be used in `expo-share-extension` for persisting data that is shared between the main app and the share extension.

## Usage

1. Run Prebuild

```bash
npm run prebuild
```

2. Start the app via Expo CLI

```bash
npm run ios
```

3. or only start the metro server and build via XCode

```bash
npm run start
```
